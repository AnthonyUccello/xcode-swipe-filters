xcode-swipe-filters
===================

This code takes an image and lets you apply a filter as you swipe your finger along the screen in either direction. It takes the next filter in either direction and applies it in real time to match your swiping finger (like SnapChat's)

Here is video example showing what these swipe filters look like: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QmFu04Tang&list=UUIctdpq1Pzujc0u0ixMSeVw&index=2
